    question: "What are Capgemini Cognitive Ability Games?",
    answer:
      "These are game-based assessments used by Capgemini during placements to test logical reasoning, problem-solving, memory, and pattern recognition skills.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I practice the exact same games here?",

  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to create an account to practice?",
    answer:
      "No account is required to try out basic games. However, creating a free account allows you to track your progress and revisit your practice history.",
  },
  {
    question: "How should I prepare for the actual Capgemini assessment?",
    answer:
      "Regularly practice puzzles, focus on improving speed and accuracy, and review different challenge types such as Switch, Grid, Inductive, and Deductive Challenges.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this platform free to use?",
    answer:
      "Yes! All core Capgemini practice games are free to access. We aim to help students prepare effectively without barriers.",

    question: "Will practicing here really improve my chances?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Consistent practice builds confidence, improves reaction time, and strengthens your logical problem-solving skills — all of which are essential for clearing Capgemini’s games.",
